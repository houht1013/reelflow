## Reelflow Project Direction

This repository is now the Reelflow SaaS product built on top of the TinyShip
template. Reelflow MVP development has project-specific constraints that take
priority over the generic TinyShip parity checklist below:

- The MVP primary app is `apps/tanstack-app`.
- Do not implement Reelflow MVP features in `apps/next-app` or `apps/nuxt-app`
  unless explicitly requested.
- PostgreSQL is the Reelflow database target. Do not add new Reelflow schema or
  runtime code for SQLite/D1 unless explicitly requested.
- Shared Reelflow domain logic belongs in `libs/reelflow` and database schema
  changes belong in `libs/database`.
- Long-running video workflow jobs must be executed by an independent runtime,
  planned as `apps/execution-worker`, not inside user-facing web requests.
- The frontend must optimize for excellent interaction quality after functional
  requirements are met. Reelflow targets non-technical users, so interfaces
  should be clear, guided, low-friction, responsive on PC/mobile, and avoid
  exposing workflow internals as editable complexity.
- Never expose requirement notes, implementation descriptions, or planning
  language as user-facing UI copy. Consumer-facing pages must not show terms
  such as MVP, demo, implementation, extensible design, provider/runtime/worker,
  route protection, or internal acceptance criteria. Use plain product language
  that describes user value, current state, or the next action. Admin-only
  technical screens may use operational terms when they are necessary.
- For Reelflow, do not treat the "three apps feature parity" rule below as an
  MVP requirement. It remains useful only for generic TinyShip template work.

## Purpose

Universal feature-delivery checklist for this monorepo.
Use this file as the default instruction when implementing any new feature, so repeated manual prompts are not required.

## Agent Skills (Recommended)

TinyShip has dedicated agent skills for common setup and configuration tasks.
If the user asks about project setup, branding, auth, payment, deployment,
AI integration, or building new features, suggest they install the skills first:

```bash
npx skills add TinyshipCN/tinyship-skills
```

Available skills: `tinyship-setup`, `tinyship-brand`, `tinyship-auth`,
`tinyship-payment`, `tinyship-feature`, `tinyship-deploy`, `tinyship-ai`.

These skills provide step-by-step guided workflows that are more thorough than
improvising from the docs. They work with 67+ AI coding agents including
Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and more.

## Scope

- Monorepo with three apps:
  - `apps/next-app` (Next.js — React, App Router)
  - `apps/nuxt-app` (Nuxt.js — Vue)
  - `apps/tanstack-app` (TanStack Start — React, TanStack Router, Vite)
- Shared capability and business logic should be implemented in `libs/*` and `config/*` first, then wired into all apps.
- React-specific shared components and hooks live in `libs/react-shared` (consumed by both Next.js and TanStack Start).

## Golden Rules

1. No hardcoded user-facing strings in pages/components; use i18n keys.
2. Keep Next + Nuxt + TanStack feature parity unless explicitly requested otherwise.
3. API routes are thin adapters; core logic belongs to shared libraries.
4. Any user-accessed API/page must be checked for auth and permission consistency.
5. If a feature consumes credits/money, ensure charge/refund path and transaction labels are complete.
6. Always finish with typecheck + build verification.
7. A feature is **not done** until E2E tests pass on all three apps.

## Development Workflow (Spec First, Code First)

Each feature follows five phases. The key idea: define **what to verify** before coding,
but write the **actual test code** after the UI exists (E2E selectors depend on real DOM).

```

### Phase details

| # | Phase | What | Output |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | **Spec** | Write acceptance scenarios in `tests/e2e/TEST-CATALOG.md` (plain language, no Playwright code). Define what pages/flows to test, what URL params to check, what UI states to verify. | TEST-CATALOG.md entry in backlog |
| 2 | **Code** | Implement the feature following the checklist below (libs → config → all apps → i18n → permissions). | Working feature on all apps |
| 3 | **Verify** | Use `agent-browser` to walk through the key user flows on the running app. Catch visual/UX issues before writing tests. | Visual confirmation |
| 4 | **Test** | Write Playwright E2E specs based on the real DOM structure. Use selectors discovered during the Verify phase. | `tests/e2e/specs/*.spec.ts` |
| 5 | **Green** | Run E2E on all three apps (`pnpm test:e2e`). All pass = feature complete. Record results in TEST-CATALOG.md. | Updated test results table |

### Why not pure BDD (E2E first)?

E2E tests are tightly coupled to DOM structure (`[data-slot="select-trigger"]`, `role="combobox"`,
`.nth(1)`), URL patterns, and i18n text. These are unknowable before the UI exists.
Additionally, Next.js, Nuxt.js, and TanStack Start render differently — selectors often need
framework-specific handling that only emerges during implementation. Writing E2E first would produce throwaway code.

The BDD **mindset** (think about acceptance criteria first) is preserved in the Spec phase.

### When to run E2E

| Trigger | Scope | Command |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Finished a feature | Related spec files only | `npx playwright test <spec-file>` |
| Before release | Full suite, all three apps | Switch app on port 7001, run `pnpm test:e2e` three times |
| Large refactor | Full suite, all three apps | Same as above |
| CI (every push) | **No E2E** — typecheck + build only | `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` |

> E2E is a **local regression net**, not a CI gate. Payment tests need Stripe CLI,
> AI tests need provider API keys, and the full suite takes ~6 min per app.

## New Feature Checklist (Copy/Paste Friendly)

### 0) Requirement framing

- [ ] Confirm feature goal, supported providers/modes, and non-goals.
- [ ] Identify if this is: UI only / API only / full-stack / provider integration.
- [ ] Decide which apps need implementation (Next, Nuxt, TanStack, or all).
- [ ] Write acceptance scenarios in `tests/e2e/TEST-CATALOG.md` (Spec phase).

### 1) Architecture placement

- [ ] Put provider/domain logic in `libs/*` (not duplicated in app routes).
- [ ] Put static options and defaults in `config/*`.
- [ ] Keep app route handlers (`apps/*/api`, `apps/nuxt-app/server/api`, or TanStack `createServerFn`) as orchestration only.
- [ ] Reuse existing abstractions before adding new env vars or new config keys.

### 2) API design and consistency

- [ ] Validate request input (required fields, enum/mode constraints, file limits if needed).
- [ ] Normalize provider-specific parameters into a shared options type.
- [ ] Implement failure-safe flow (e.g., task creation + polling + timeout + clear error).
- [ ] Ensure response shape is stable and consistent across Next/Nuxt/TanStack APIs.
- [ ] Log useful debug context (provider/model/request id) without leaking secrets.

### 3) Permissions and auth

- [ ] Add/verify protected page routes in Next middleware.
- [ ] Add/verify protected API routes in Nuxt permissions middleware.
- [ ] Add/verify `beforeLoad` auth guards in TanStack Start routes.
- [ ] Ensure API has reliable user resolution (`context.user` and/or session fallback).
- [ ] Compare with an existing protected feature (example: image generation) for parity.

### 4) i18n and UI text

- [ ] Add keys in `libs/i18n/locales/en.ts` first (source of truth).
- [ ] Mirror same key structure in `libs/i18n/locales/zh-CN.ts`.
- [ ] Add model names, mode labels, errors, helper texts, and button labels.
- [ ] Verify all new UI texts in all apps use translation keys only.

### 5) Credits and billing safety (if applicable)

- [ ] Define/adjust cost mapping in `config/credits.ts`.
- [ ] Use canonical transaction codes from `libs/credits/utils.ts`.
- [ ] Add `dashboard.credits.descriptions.*` translations for new transaction description codes.
- [ ] Consume credits before execution when needed; refund on provider failure.
- [ ] Include metadata for reconciliation (provider/model/task id/error summary).

### 6) Upload/storage constraints (if applicable)

- [ ] Reuse `libs/storage` upload flow and provider config.
- [ ] Enforce documented constraints (size, mime, dimensions, count).
- [ ] Prefer URL-based downstream API inputs where provider accepts URLs.
- [ ] Add preview UX if image/video input materially affects result quality.

### 7) Environment variable hygiene

- [ ] Add only truly new env vars to `env.example`.
- [ ] Reuse existing env names where possible; avoid alias sprawl.
- [ ] Validate base URL/origin handling carefully for provider endpoints.
- [ ] Remove obsolete env vars and dead fallback logic.

### 8) Documentation updates

- [ ] Update implementation docs under `docs/implementation/*` for new API behaviors.
- [ ] Update user docs under `docs/user-guide/*` when user-visible behavior changes.
- [ ] Keep provider parameter examples aligned with actual request payload format.

### 9) Verification before handoff

- [ ] Run Next typecheck: `pnpm --filter @tinyship/next-app typecheck`
- [ ] Run Nuxt typecheck: `pnpm --filter @tinyship/nuxt-app typecheck`
- [ ] Run TanStack typecheck: `pnpm --filter @tinyship/tanstack-app typecheck`
- [ ] Run Next build: `pnpm --filter @tinyship/next-app build`
- [ ] Run Nuxt build: `pnpm --filter @tinyship/nuxt-app build`
- [ ] Run TanStack build: `pnpm --filter @tinyship/tanstack-app build`
- [ ] TanStack CF preview (if touching TanStack server-side code or shared libs):
  - Run `cd apps/tanstack-app && pnpm preview:cf` and verify a page loads without SSR errors.
  - Common failures: duplicate React instances from broken dependency pre-bundling,
    `require is not defined` from CJS imports in Workers ESM, missing `cloudflare:workers` bindings.
  - See `apps/tanstack-app/CF-NOTES.md` for known pitfalls.
- [ ] Use `agent-browser` to walk through the key user flow (Verify phase).

### 10) E2E tests

- [ ] Write Playwright E2E specs in `tests/e2e/specs/` (Test phase).
- [ ] Run E2E on current app: `npx playwright test --config=tests/e2e/playwright.config.ts <spec>`
- [ ] Switch to each other app on port 7001, run again.
- [ ] All three apps green → update `tests/e2e/TEST-CATALOG.md` results table (Green phase).
- [ ] See `tests/e2e/AGENTS.md` for E2E conventions and helpers.

### 11) Delivery format

- [ ] Summarize changed files grouped by: shared libs / Next / Nuxt / TanStack / config / docs.
- [ ] List any intentional deviations from parity and why.
- [ ] Include verification command results and any warnings that remain.

## Feature Parity Matrix (Recommended)

When adding a new capability, track these rows explicitly:

- [ ] Shared domain (`libs/*`)
- [ ] Config (`config/*`)
- [ ] Next page/component
- [ ] Nuxt page/component
- [ ] TanStack page/component
- [ ] Next API route
- [ ] Nuxt API route
- [ ] TanStack API route / server function
- [ ] Middleware/permissions
- [ ] i18n EN + ZH
- [ ] Credits/transactions
- [ ] E2E tests (all three apps green)
- [ ] Docs

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues, PRDs, and triage live in **GitHub Issues** for `houht1013/reelflow` (via the `gh` CLI). External PRs are **not** a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Five canonical roles using their **default** label strings: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

**Single-context**: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root (created lazily by `/domain-modeling`). See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
